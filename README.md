## 🎯 Introduction
Modern customers expect highly personalized experiences that cater to their unique preferences. We are developing a Generative AI-driven solution that enhances hyper-personalization by analyzing customer profiles, social media activity, purchase history, sentiment data and demographic details. The challenge is to design a system that generates personalized recommendations for products, services or content while also providing actionable insights for business to optimize customer engagement.

## 💡 Inspiration
E-commerce, finance, and digital platforms need advanced personalization, but current solutions rely on rigid rule-based or collaborative filtering approaches

We use Generative AI and Multi-Modal Learning to enhance recommendation quality by incorporating structured and unstructured data sources.

## ⚙️ What It Does
•	Customer Segmentation: Clusters users based on transactions, social media sentiment, and profiles.
•	Personalized Recommendations: Uses a RAG-based LLM system to generate targeted offers.
•	Data Ingestion & Preprocessing: Handles structured (CSV) and unstructured (social media text) data.
•	Ethical AI & Fairness Checks: Integrates AI Fairness 360 to detect bias in recommendations.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks & Libraries:
•	Synthetic Data Generation: SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)
•	Feature Engineering: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Transformers (Hugging Face)
•	RAG-Based Recommendation: FAISS, LangChain, GPT-J / FLAN-T5
•	Frontend: Streamlit
•	Bias Detection: AI Fairness 360

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
•	Multi-Modal Data Handling: Merging structured and unstructured data seamlessly.
•	Efficient Retrieval in RAG: Optimizing FAISS for real-time recommendations.
•	Ethical Considerations: Ensuring fairness in recommendations.
•	LLM Constraints: Avoiding paid APIs and focusing on open-source models.
